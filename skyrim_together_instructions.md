**GETTING STARTED**

First things first, make sure you have downloaded Vortex Mod Manager (hereafter referred to as VMM or Vortex), and make
sure it's up-to-date by downloading the latest file [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files). Once 
that's installed and up-to-date, delete all Skyrim Special Edition mods:

1. Open Vortex and go to the main mods page for Skyrim Special Edition.
2. Select all mods at once using shift+click.
3. Once all are selected, there should be options at the bottom of the window. Click "remove" and make sure to check 
the box that says "delete archives".
  - If you have multiple versions of any mods installed, you may need to repeat this step a few times.

Next, you'll need to *uninstall Skyrim Special Edition from Steam*. We also need to *remove any save game files* 
associated with the game. If you haven't moved it or you don't have an unusual setup, the default location for this is 
`C:\Users\{$USER_NAME}\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition`. It should be a small-ish folder of no more than 1GB 
with some `.ini` files, a "Saves" folder, and maybe an "SKSE" folder. Delete this whole Skyrim Special Edition folder.

Now, you should have a PC with no Skyrim Special Edition files or mods whatsoever--a clean slate. You can now reinstall 
Skyrim Special Edition. Once this is done, *boot up once and get to the title screen before quitting again*. Doing this 
initializes some config files, and not doing this could mean wonky behavior later on. With this done, we should be able 
to get started downloading mods.

**MODS**

Please be sure to download all mods *before* installing any of them. I have provided links for each. Unless otherwise 
specified, use the mod manager/vortex download. If there are multiple files to choose from, I will specify which one(s) 
to grab. After finishing each of the following sections, double check to make sure you got everything. All file names 
in "" are exactly the ones you should be grabbing, to the letter. Everything on Nexus Mods marked as "old files" can 
be safely ignored.

**MOD INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS**

You should be able to install each mod more or less in the order that I've listed them above. One important caveat is 
that you need to leave any mod file that says "patch" or "patches" until the end. Install them one at a time; don't try 
to speed things up by installing them in parallel.

To install Legacy of the Dragonborn, click on the "install from file" button at the top left of the mods page on 
Vortex and select the mod file you should have downloaded manually.

If you messed up and accidentally installed a patch mod before the end, you can always reinstall the mod from the 
drop-down menu next to the "remove" button.

Occasionally, you will be presented with a pop-up window with options to choose when you install a mod. Here are the 
options you'll need to select for each occurrence:

- Beyond Skyrim - Bruma
  - Custom Map Markers? => "Custom Map Markers"
- Beyond Skyrim - Assets
  - Custom Map Markers? => "Custom Map Markers"
- Immersive Armors
  - Options => none
- Left Hand Rings Modified SE
  - Main => "Left Hand Rings Modified"
  - Models and Textures => "Static Mesh Improvement Mod"
  - Optional => "1st Person View for Left Hand Rings"
  - Compatibility Patches => "Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch"
  - Rings of Blood Magic Setup =>" Option 1"
- Legendary Artifacts
  - Quick Install => "Artifacts"
- Cloaks of Skyrim
  - Pick Version => "Main Version"
- Realistic Water Two SE
  - Core => "Core Files"
  - Optional Textures => none
  - Watercolors => none
  - Optional Patches => "Beyond Skyrim: Bruma SE"
- Static Mesh Improvement Mod
  - Skyrim Game Version and Install Choices => "Skyrim 2016 Special Edition: Everything"

  - Quest Displays => "Helgen Reborn"
  - Overhaul Systems => none
  - Additional Patches A-M => "Legendary Artifacts"
  - Additional Patches N-Z => "Unread Books Glow"
  - Manually Selectable Patches => "Static Mesh Improvment Mod"
  - Legacy Book Covers Skyrim Patches => none

**MOD CONFLICT RESOLUTION**

Once all mods are both installed and enabled, we need to resolve load order conflicts. At the top of the Vortex mods 
page, there is a button marked "manage rules". Click that, then select "use suggested". This will automatically sort 
your mods' load order.

***

**FINAL MOD LOAD ORDER**

Go to the Mods page, click "Open..." => "Open Game Application Data Folder", then open loadorder.txt. You can 
copy/paste the list from my [loadorder.txt](https://github.com/sirarkhon/random-stuff/blob/main/loadorder.txt) into one 
text pane on [diffchecker.com](https://www.diffchecker.com/) and your loadorder.txt into the other one and see if they 
differ without having to go line by line to see what you might need to change. If there are discrepancies, go to the 
"Plugins" section in Vortex and sort by the load order column to more easily make changes.
