**INSTRUCTIONS**
First, wipe your computer of everything Skyrim Special Edition. Remove any mods you may currently have installed,
uninstall the game from Steam, and delete your saved games folder (probably at \Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special
Edition).

Reinstall Skyrim Special Edition from Steam. Then, boot up the game once.

Ensure you have Vortex mod manager from Nexus mods (https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/?) downloaded and updated to
the latest version.

Install USSEP, SKSE, and Address Library for SKSE Plugins first. Legacy of the Dragonborn will need to be installed
directly from an archive file you manually download by using the "Install From File" option right below the game
selector dropdown at top left. Unless I say otherwise, whenever a mod pops up a window presenting you with options,
go with the default.

Cross-mod patches (e.g. Relic Hunter, which extends Alternate Start to support Legacy of the Dragonborn) should be
installed after all mods associated with the patch. Major patch packages, such as for Legacy of the Dragonborn or
Beyond Skyrim, should go last.

**MOD CONFLICT RESOLUTION**
- Click "Manage Rules" on the header menu on the mods page of Vortex.
- Click "Use Suggestions" at the bottom of the pop-up box.
- Click "Use Suggested" again on this warning pop-up box.
- Click "Save".

**FINAL MOD LOAD ORDER**
Go to the Mods page, click "Open..." => "Open Game Application Data Folder", then open loadorder.txt. You can 
copy/paste the list from my[loadorder.txt](https://github.com/sirarkhon/random-stuff/blob/main/loadorder.txt) into one 
text pane on[diffchecker.com](https://www.diffchecker.com/) and your loadorder.txt into the other one and see if they 
differ without having to go line by line to see what you might need to change. If there are discrepancies, go to the 
"Plugins" section in Vortex and sort by the load order column to more easily make changes.
